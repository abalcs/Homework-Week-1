CODE REFACTOR

This project has been refactored from the original code to include semantic elements wherever possible in order to increase accessibility.  

**HTML**

The title has been updated to be more specific.

The Search Engine Optimization link in the nav has been fixed to correctly link to the main section content and all images have been given alt descriptions.

**CSS**

Semantic elements have been updated over class links where possible and some of the Main content has been re-positioned for better document flow.  

For fun I also used 'scroll-behavior: smooth' for a better page transition when clicking the links in the nav bar.
